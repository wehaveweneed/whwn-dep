Welcome to We Have, We Need's documentation!

Reference Documentation
=======================

TODO: I have not set up auto-doc yet to generate reference documentation from
the source code yet. I'm not sure we have any comments in our source code
anyways. This is where we would have links to directory layout, an overview of
our application stack and relevant services, API stuff.
